TODO
objective is not clear enough, better intro would help, better signalling to get back home might too? Probably worth doing a door-lock thing for the first one.
changing firing direction when climbing is hard
no animations for firing when climbing/jumping

DONE
climbing jumps need easier intro
rabbit knocked off ledge is buggy (think I just need to disable rabbit/player collisions)
climbing fall timer should be a bit slower
climbing could stand to be a bit less fussy about grabs
