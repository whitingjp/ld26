TODO
need a more convincing intro/hunger cutscene?
need a completion cutscene
need a meal cutscene
saving would be good
disable editor button
mochibot
sitelock?

DONE
climbing jumps need easier intro
rabbit knocked off ledge is buggy (think I just need to disable rabbit/player collisions)
climbing fall timer should be a bit slower
climbing could stand to be a bit less fussy about grabs
objective is not clear enough, probably worth doing a door-lock thing for the first one.
changing firing direction when climbing is hard
greebles have gaps
no animations for firing when climbing/jumping/swingin
