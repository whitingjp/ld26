TODO
objective is not clear enough, better intro would help, better signalling to get back home might too?
changing firing direction when climbing is hard

DONE
climbing jumps need easier intro
rabbit knocked off ledge is buggy (think I just need to disable rabbit/player collisions)
climbing fall timer should be a bit slower
climbing could stand to be a bit less fussy about grabs
