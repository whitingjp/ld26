TODO
climbing could stand to be a bit less fussy about grabs
rabbit knocked off ledge is buggy (think I just need to disable rabbit/player collisions)
objective is not clear enough, better intro would help, better signalling to get back home might too?
climbing fall timer should be a bit slower

DONE
climbing jumps need easier intro
